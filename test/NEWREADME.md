# Reverse Shell in JavaScript
This is a very simple implementation of reverse shell in JavaScript(Node.js). It used to be a final project for CS 460 Security Lab class and was written in Python. I have just rewritten everything in JavaScript this time.     

The old README can be found here <a href="./README.md">here</a>
